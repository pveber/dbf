DBF format parsing
==================

This is a small library meant to parse [dBase
database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.dbf) file format. My goal was
to parse a *single* file so I did not consider all
variants. Nevertheless, I tried my best to write the parser in a clear
way, so that it should hopefully be quite simple to improve it to
handler more casees. Don't hesitate to open an issue to discuss an
extension.

## Installation

```
opam install dbf
```
